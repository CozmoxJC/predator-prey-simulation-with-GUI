# predator-prey-simulation-with-GUI
Adding a GUI to the predator-prey simulation. 
It allows user to select which simulation(species involved) they want to do, set the simulation field size they want, and show the progress of the simulation and result. 


* There are five species(rabbits, foxes, wolves, bears and hunters) involved in this project.

  You can select how many species you want to run simulation, and select which species you want to simulate exactly by comboboxes.


* Only show the result after certain steps(with default steps or typed steps), CAN'T SHOW THE PROGRESS DURING SIMULATION.

*It's extension of the project "foxes-and-rabbits-v2" by David J. Barnes and Michael Kolling.
