# predator-prey-simulation-with-GUI
Adding a GUI to the predator-prey simulation.

It can allow users to choose which simulation(species involved) they want to do, set the simulation field size they want, and show the progress of the simulation and result.  

The question is after I generate the field, I can't reset the simulation or run the next step or run the next hundred steps by clicking the buttons I set, not to mention show the progress of the simulation.
